Jetpack Cube
============

In this project, I developed a simple yet engaging player-controlled character that moves with realistic physics. The objective is to collect points while avoiding enemies.
This project was part of my Game Development minor, a program jointly offered by Bezalel Academy of Art and Design and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
